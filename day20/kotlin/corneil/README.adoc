== Donut Maze

=== Part 1

My previous work on the mazes came in handy for this one.
I had to identify the tiles that were portal and add edges to connect them to each other.

=== Part 2

In this case I would create an inner Grid and connect all the inner portal tiles or the outer grid to the outer portal tiles of the inner grid.
If I don't find a solution then I add another inner grid.

Had to increase the stack size on JVM for the final solution.
