== Day 25: Cryostasis

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/21

== Star 1
this was quite stressfull, having to implement all variants of items as ascii orders, but at the end it worked out!

== Star 2
well, Santa's message is, that I am missing 12 stars to proceed, means I have to work out all the last day's parts. THIS WAS GREAT FUN! - SPECIAL THANKS TO RALF!
