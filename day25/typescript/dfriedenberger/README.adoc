== Cryostasis

The solutions are written in Typescript. To run them use the following commands.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
....

=== First Start

First I explored the ship and take the items. Don't take all, especially not the infinity loop.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution1.ts[tag=explore]
....

Than go to the "Security Checkpoint".
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution1.ts[tag=gotocheckpoint]
....

And test all combinations of items to pass.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution1.ts[tag=testitems]
....

=== Second Star

Nothing to do. :-)
