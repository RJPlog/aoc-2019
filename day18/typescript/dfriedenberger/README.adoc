== Many-Worlds Interpretation

The solutions are written in Typescript. To run them use the following commands.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
node dist/solution2.js
....

I found an approach to search shortest path from start position, by iterate over each reachable key from a node.
But this approach has runtime of O(n!). So hat to cheat a little bit and found optimation with cache.

The combinations after passing through the three nodes a,b,c and from node c are the same

@ -> a -> b -> c

@ -> b -> a -> c


[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/TunnelMap.ts[tag=cache]
....

With this approach found solution within seconds.

=== First Star

Solved by searching shortest path with all nodes.


=== Second Star

Second solution solved by search for path in each separate sections assuming that the missing keys for doors collected by the others robots.
