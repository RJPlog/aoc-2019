== Many-Worlds Interpretation

=== Part 1

This is like the traveling salesman.
I could not get an algorithm that passed all the tests.
The one that had some success ran far too long.
Too many permutations to consider.

Trying to think how a search will work when the tree is not a binary tree.

I now have a recursive search that works but runs a long.

Started looking around at solutions by other people and found one I could understand and why I as failing.
