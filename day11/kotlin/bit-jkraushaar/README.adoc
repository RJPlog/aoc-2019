== Day 11

Intcode computer is back! ðŸ˜Ž

I started by copy-pasting (as every good software engineer does) my Intcode computer from day 9.
Find the complete source code of the Intcode computer at the end.

Next I defined an abstraction of the panels to be painted.
My panels consist of coordinates (using Kotlins `Pair` data type) and a color.

Next the painting robot.
I tried to use a Kotlin `object`, but it seems that Kotlin scripts cannot handle them.
So it is basically a class containing my Intcode computer CPU, its current coordinates, all visited panels, the command state and the direction.
The command state is to tell my robot how to interpret the next output of the CPU.
The `readCamera()` and `next(Long)` functions are used as input and output functions for the CPU.

With everything set up, I can now start to solve the puzzles.

=== First Star

The first star is as simple as:

. Load the program
. Start the robot
. Check the size of the set containing all visited panels

=== Second Star

For the second star, the robot is initialized with white color (`1`).
I extract the min and max values of x and y coordinates.
Then I iterate over the x and y values and print the color to the console.

Please note two things:

* I had to iterate from max y down to min y, because otherwise it prints mirror-inverted letters
* I am using `!!` to disable Kotlins null-check. Don`t do this at home.
