== Day 17: Set and Forget

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/17

== Star 1
For part1 I adapted my IntCode program to the puzzle and run it through the 50x50 area, counting every attraction point

== Star 2 
For part2 I started inside the beam with the acutal position of the upper left edge, means there is an actraction point (shape of the beam is known out of part1).

If in x and y direction plus 100-1 no attraction point is to be found, then the beam is to narrow, and I increase x (if in y direction the 100's are not covered) or increase y (if in x direction the 100's are not covered) or  both. 

This will lead to the nearest point. When doing so, one have to consider the gain of the beam while increasing x or y, if your gain is wrong you may end up outside the beam, if so this will be corrected inside the program.
