== Slam Shuffle

=== Part 1

This was interesting and reasonable.

=== Part 2

It was obvious that I would need to change the code to calculate the indexes and reverse versions of all the functions.

After implementing functions to calculate the transformations I realized the reverse increment function is problematic.

I am not equipped for Advent of Math.
My implementation breaks down in some cases and since it is a modular function I don't know of any solver techniques that would even help.
With the large numbers if Long is going to have potential issues.
So I'm using BigInteger for the parts that may have a problem.
