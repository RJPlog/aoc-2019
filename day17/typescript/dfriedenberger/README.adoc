== Set and Forget

The solutions are written in Typescript. To run them use the following commands.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
node dist/solution1find.js
node dist/solution2.js
....



=== First Start

Implement Panel class for load output to x-y-field data structure and calulate alignment.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/Panel.ts[tags=load;getIntersectionAlignmentSum]
....

=== Second Star


First resolved path along the scaffold under the assumption, the robot would always run straight on for as long as possible.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/Panel.ts[tag=getPath]
....

Result tested manually for pattern and noticed that'a a possible solution.

[yellow-background]#L,8,R,10,L,8,R,8,# *L,12,R,8,R,8,* [yellow-background]#L,8,R,10,L,8,R,8,# L,8,R,6,R,6,R,10,L,8,
L,8,R,6,R,6,R,10,L,8,[yellow-background]#L,8,R,10,L,8,R,8,# *L,12,R,8,R,8,* L,8,R,6,R,6,R,10,L,8, *L,12,R,8,R,8,* *L,12,R,8,R,8*

which could be split into submodules 

A,B,A,C,C,A,B,C,B,B
